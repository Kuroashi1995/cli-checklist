# cli-checklist
## Description
This is my first personal project for the [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) backend path.
It's a simple cli todo list in a checkmark presentation.
It's meant to be simple, fleeting and useful.
## Features:
- Shows todo list in the terminal
- Add, complete, delete todo from list
- Clear all tasks
- Clear completed tasks

## Future Implementations:
- [ ] Give random sidequest function
- [ ] Add your own sidequests function
- [ ] Preferences persistance
- [ ] Temporal text highlighting to quickfind words in todos
- [ ] Edit todo functionality

## Usage
1. [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run with `python3 main.py`
